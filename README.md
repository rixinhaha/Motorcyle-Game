# Motorcyle-Game
The pc version a motorcycle racing game I built using the Unity game engine. There is a timers that is constantly decreasing once you start the game. To win the game, the player has to complete the circuit before time runs out. To do so, the player must collect time-boosts and shoot rays at the barrels blocking the way. When a barrel is destroyed, a time boost will also be given.
